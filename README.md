# Google-Similarweb-API

An API-based project, which gets a list of brands from an excel file,
gets the first organic url from Google for each one
and gets the relevant information from Similarweb for that URL.

For reasons of efficiency, the API calls are done for every 5 brands simultaneously.

The information is added to a new excel file called results
